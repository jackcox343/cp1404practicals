Estimates and Accuracy in Practical Tasks:
My accuracy improved over the course of the subject as I gained a better understanding of the workflow and coding knowledge. 
There was importance of learning from initial estimations, analyzing any discrepancies, and adapting my approach. 
Retrospection was important in refining my estimation skills.

Code Reviews and Lessons Learned from Both Sides:
Participating in code reviews has been a valuable learning experience. 
I've valuable gained insights into different perspectives and improving my code quality. 
Reviewing code taught me the importance of constructive feedback which is not just about finding errors but 
fostering a collaborating for knowledge sharing and improvement in coding skills.

Reflection on Practical Tasks Overall:
If I were in charge of the subject, I would introduce a coding application that people can practice with
and gain instant feedback. This would provide students with opportunities to 
enhancing their coding skills. Additionally, fostering a collaborative environment 
with regular discussions could help pass information around.
